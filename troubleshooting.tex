\chapter{Troubleshooting}
If you think you have found a bug please report this to\\
{\tt beerli@csit.fsu.edu}.
I would like to know every warning you see while you compile the program, if you send me 
bug-reports please include  your hardware and system specifications, your
{\tt infile}, your {\tt parmfile} (if any), and 
a ``printout'' of the warnings or errors.
   
BUT, mostly, the problem is that the data in the infile is in a wrong format:
you can expect the program to crash when you try to use 
the {\tt datatype=Allelic} and your
infile contains sequence data.  
I am trying to reduce the number of strange error messages, 
but this has lower priority than adding new features/improving code.

{\bf Please, before you report a bug, compare your infile with the examples}.
