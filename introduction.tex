\myabstract{The program \migrate estimates population size, migration, population splitting parameters using genetic/genomic data.}

For many purposes in biology, we need to know the effective population size of a population and also how well populations interact with other populations. there are essentially two very different approaches to get such information: a behavioral or ecological approach that asks for monitoring of individuals in a focus population and recognize residents and newcomers. Often individuals are marked with tags or other means (banding in birds, toe clipping in amphibians, and more recently inserting magnetic tags under the skin of animals). Such approaches are difficult with large populations, or small number of immigrants, or species that have a hidden lifestyle. \\

Since 1960 an alternative approach has been used. This approach uses the genetic makeup of an individual as a tag and measures similarities (or differentials) among groups of individuals. This work led to estimators such as $F_{ST}$, that indicate how isolated populations are from each other and several other measures that are based on allele frequencies within populations or individuals. These methods are most often based on simple population models that were invented by Sewall Wright and Ronald Fisher. The most common applications used the Wright-Fisher population model that assumes that the population does not grow or shrink, that every individual has the same chance to reproduce and that every generation that population of adults is replaced by their offspring. Interestingly, this simply model was (and is) amazingly stable and even applications to species where such a model seems outlandish (Elephants, humans, etc) allowed considerably insight into the history of populations. Unfortunately, practitioners are still using these methods despite considerable advances of population genetic theory. Problematic issues with these allele frequency approaches mostly stem from the fact that the assumptions of symmetric immigration rates and equal population sizes need to be fulfilled \citep{beerli:2004:EUP}.\\

Recent approaches based on the coalescent \citep{kingman:2000:oc} allow better formulation of explicit probabilistic model that can handle different immigration rates and different population sizes, and also the addition of additional complications, such as recombination, population splitting etc.
\migrate in its most simple form can only handle population sizes, immigration rates, and some forms of population splittings, therefore may be not suitable for all datasets. But often, it may help to decide what to do next, despite potential problems with assumption violation \citep{beerli:2009:wid}. \\

This manual describes the program \migrate, its benefits, but also its shortcomings. You will learn in detail about how to use the program and what options are available. This manual is only a start, I suggest that you subscribe to the {\tt migrate-support@googlegroups.com} and participate in the community that uses \migrate. Tutorials are also available on the \migrate website.
