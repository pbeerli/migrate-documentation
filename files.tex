\chapter{Files in \migrate}

\myabstract{\migrate can use many different input methods and output methods, but most of them have a very special purpose, as a minimum you need to supply an input datafile, here called \textsl{infile}.}

%\subsection*{Short description of all files \migrate\ can use or generate}
There are multiple ways to set up things. \migrate\ can use very different ways to manipulate the data and as a result many different files are needed or produced. Minimally, you need the data file, its default name is {\sl infile}, and \migrate\ produces two files that contains results: the \textsl{outfile} (ASCII text file) and a PDF output file that contains the same information (well almost, as you see later). The program produces both formats because for quick checking of results the ASCII file can be opened on the command line or with any text viewer, whereas the PDF file requires a PDF reader, for example for macs Preview.app and for windows NitroPDF; unfortunately modern versions of the standard Adobe Acrobat Reader fail to read the PDF files generated by \migrate correctly -- I will work on porting my PDF writer to a newer system, but this has low priority and will take a while (Older versions of Adobe Reader work fine!)

\subsection{Main input files}
\begin{description}
\item{\bf infile} if this file is not present in the current directory 
than the program will ask for a data file, and you can
give the path to it, you need to type the path, which is for Macintosh and Windows users probably rather uncomfortable. In the {\bf menu} or {\bf parmfile} you can specify an other default name for your datafile. 
\item{\bf datefile} When the samples came from different years and you believe that this makes a different specify the date as the time backward from today (for example years before 2007). With this analysis type, you need to specify a mutation rate in the same units as the dates of the samples.
%\item{\bf sumfile} The sumfile allows the reuse of a previous maximum likelihood run (see more under sumfile in the output file section), the data type menu needs to be set to "Genealogy".
\item{\bf bayesallfile} The  \texttt{bayesallfile}  or  \texttt{bayesallfile.gz} allows to reuse a previous Bayesian inference run, the parmfile needs to have the option \\
\texttt{recover=YES}\\
This option cannot be created with the menu.
All the other options in the parmfile should be the same as when the \texttt{bayesallfile} was created.
\end{description}
\subsection{Optional input files}
\begin{description}
\item{\bf parmfile} can hold specific menu options, this file and the possible options for the menu are explained in detail in section {\bf menu and parmfile}.
%\item{\bf seedfile} holds a random number seed, this is just present for compatibility with PHYLIP, the random number seed can be set in various
%ways either in the menu or in the parmfile. [this random number seed option should not be used]
\item{\bf geofile} holds the geographic or arbitrary distances between the populations. When this is used then the migration rates are not only scaled by the mutation rate but also by this distance. This allows to detect environmental barriers when we assume that the genetic potential to migrate is the same in all populations; without a barrier the rates should be all the same per distance unit. The format is like a distance file in the PHYLIP package \citep{Felsenstein}, but you can use the {\tt \#} as a commentary character.\\
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
# Example geofile for 3 populations, 
# the order of the population must be the same as in the data file
# 
  3
Tallahasse0.0 10.0 150.0
St.Marks  10.0 0.0 160.0
Pensacola 150.0 160.0 0.0
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
The example scales the mutation-scaled migration rates by the 'geographic' distance. If the migration rate is linear with the inverse of the distance then the migration rates between all locations will be the same, here we scale the migration rate per distance unit, therefore if we have a range of 0 to 160 miles, the rates are are scaled per mile. As a result migration rates will be all relatively high because a mile is usually not a large distance for vagile species. 
%\item{\bf distfile} holds distances between all individuals (need to be in the same order as the data file). The distance file has the same format as the PHYLIP distance file format. Use this only if you suspect that \migrate\ does not recover from its own UPGMA start tree. [This option should probably not be used for data analysis.]

%\item{\bf catfile} hold the categories. For each locus you must give
%the number of categories, and the value of each category and then a string of
%category assignments for each site. You can use the {\tt \#} as a commentary character.\\
%\begin{small}
%\begin{verbatim}
%# Example catfile for two loci with 40 and 30 bp each
%#
%2 1 10  1111111111111111111122222222222222222222
%3 1 3 9 111111111122223333333333222222
%\end{verbatim}
%\end{small}
%\item{\bf weightfile}, for each site and locus you need to give a weight, acceptable weights are
%integers from 0 - 9 and letters A-Z, A is the weight 10, B 11 and so on, in total
%there are 35 possible different weights possible. { You need  a weight string for
%each locus}. [if you use this option please let me know]\\
%\begin{small}
%\begin{verbatim}
%# Example weightfile for two loci with 40 and 30 bp each

\hline

\end{center}
\subsection{Main output files}
Some conbination of the output files are not possible, for example a standard Bayesian run will not fill values into the treefile, etc.
\begin{description}
\item{\bf outfile} and {\bf outfile.pdf}  Somewhere you want to read the results, that is it! The name \textbf{outfile} is the default, but can be changed either in the menu or the parmfile. The PDF file contains graphical representation of some of the table and values. Currently, most of the output is represented in the PDF file, when you used the Bayesian inference setting, with Maximum likelihood there are still some options that are not supported in the PDF file (I still lack a programmer to do all this).
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item{\bf treefile} holds all, only those of the last chain, or 
the best tree(s). The likelihood of each tree is given ($\prob(\mathcal D\ |\ \G)$) in a comment. The programs writes trees with migrations using the Newick format with extensions from the Nexus format. Such trees containing migration events can be printed using the program \texttt{Eventtree} (or short \texttt{ET}) (distributed from http://popgen.scs.fsu.edu/et).
Writing trees to a treefile adds
some burden to the program, it will run slower, especially with the option BEST. Parallel runs increase the communication with the master node and therefore may slow down your run. 

%\item{\bf mathfile [ML only]} holds the raw likelihood surface data, if this was requested in the options. The name mathfile is the default, but can be changed in the menu or parmfile (see appendix). This option seems to produce crashes on some parallel runs. Do not use it on Bayesian inference runs either because the data for the mathfile does not get filled in, this may appear at one time because the plot function that fills in the mathfile could in principle show posterior distributions of all immigrations and all ``emigrations" (this means only the emigrants that successfully arrive at the other populations in the study).
%
%\item{\bf sumfile [ML only]} holds the summaries of all genealogies, if this was requested in the parmfile or menu. The name \textbf{sumfile} is the default. This option allows you to reanalyze a previous run for likelihood ratio test or profile likelihoods.

\item{\bf bayesfile} holds the posterior histogram data show in the PDF files. You can use other program packages like the matplotlib package in python (http://www.python.org), GNUPLOT (http://www.gnuplot.org), or the GMT package (http:www.soest.hawaii.org/gmt2) to recreate the histograms.
\item{\bf bayesallfile} holds the raw posterior values for all parameters. This option reduces the memory footprint by writing all intermediate results to disk and then rereads them for summarizing and printing the final results. This file can be also used to independently test whether \migrate converged or not using the program \tracer \citep{Rambaut:2007,Drummond:2007}, \migrate uses a simple 1-step Effective sample size (ESS) calculator that may not always be very accurate, although comparison showed that seeing high autocorrelation in \migrate means to see high autocorrelation (small ESS) in \tracer.

\item{\bf mighistfile} holds the histogram over time of the frequency of migration and coalescence events, with simulated data these plots show typically an exponential decay. When there were changes of parameters over time then the data will enforce different patterns, that can be used to discuss the results.

\item{\bf skylinefile} holds the averages of the expected parameter values at specific times. These plots are similar to the skyline plot reported in \beast \citep{Drummond:2005:BCI}, although their derivation is an extension of the original skyline plots of \citep{strimmer:2001:EDH}. \migrate reports changes of population sizes and migration rates over time and summarizes over multiple loci.
