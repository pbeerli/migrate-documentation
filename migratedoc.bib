  abstract	= {A maximum likelihood estimator based on the coalescent for
		  unequal migration rates and different subpopulation sizes
		  is developed. The method uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo
		  approach to investigate possible genealogies with branch
		  lengths and with migration events. Properties of the new
		  method are shown by using simulated data from a
		  four-population n-island model and a source-sink population
		  model. Our estimation method as coded in MIGRATE is tested
		  against GENETREE; both programs deliver a very similar
		  likelihood surface. The algorithm converges to the
		  estimates fairly quickly, even when the Markov chain is
		  started from unfavorable parameters. The method was used to
		  estimate gene flow in the Nile valley by using mtDNA data
		  from three human populations.}

  abstract	= {This paper studies gene trees in subdivided populations
		  which are constructed as perfect phylogenies from the
		  pattern of mutations in a sample of DNA sequences and
		  presents a new recursion for the probability distribution
		  of such gene trees. The underlying evolutionary model is
		  the coalescent process in a subdivided population. The
		  infinitely-many-sites model of mutation is assumed.
		  Ancestral inference questions that are discussed are
		  maximum likelihood estimation of migration and mutation
		  rates; detection of population growth by likelihood
		  techniques; determining the distribution of the time to the
		  most recent common ancestor of a sample of sequences;
		  determining the distribution of the age of the mutations on
		  the gene tree; determining in which subpopulation the most
		  recent common ancestor of all the sequences was;
		  determining subpopulation ancestors, where they were, and
		  times to them; and determining in which subpopulations
		  mutations occurred. A computational technique of Griffiths
		  and Tavare used is a computer intensive Markov chain
		  simulation, which simulates gene trees conditional on their
		  topology implied by the mutation pattern in the sample of
		  DNA sequences. The software GENETREE, which implements
		  these ancestral inference techniques, is available. (C)

		  history. Very few of these methods, however, have been
		  adequately evaluated for their performance in accurately
		  estimating population genetic parameters of interest. In
		  this paper, we continue a research program of evaluation of
		  population genetic methods through computer simulation.
		  Specifically, we examine the software MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 and
		  test the accuracy of this software to estimate genetic
		  diversity (Theta), migration rates, and confidence
		  intervals. We simulated nucleotide sequence data under a
		  neutral coalescent model with lengths of 500 bp and 1000
		  bp, and with three different per site Theta values of
		  (0.00025, 0.0025, 0.025) crossed with four different
		  migration rates (0.0000025, 0.025, 0.25, 2.5) to construct
		  1000 evolutionary trees per-combination
		  per-sequence-length. We found that while MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8
		  performs reasonably well in estimating genetic diversity
		  (Theta), it does poorly at estimating migration rates and
		  the confidence intervals associated with them. We recommend
		  researchers use this software with caution under conditions
		  similar to those used in this evaluation.}

		  history. Very few of these methods, however, have been
		  adequately evaluated for their performance in accurately
		  estimating population genetic parameters of interest. In
		  this paper, we continue a research program of evaluation of
		  population genetic methods through computer simulation.
		  Specifically, we examine the software MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 and
		  test the accuracy of this software to estimate genetic
		  diversity (Theta), migration rates, and confidence
		  intervals. We simulated nucleotide sequence data under a
		  neutral coalescent model with lengths of 500 bp and 1000
		  bp, and with three different per site Theta values of
		  (0.00025, 0.0025, 0.025) crossed with four different
		  migration rates (0.0000025, 0.025, 0.25, 2.5) to construct
		  1000 evolutionary trees per-combination
		  per-sequence-length. We found that while MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8
		  performs reasonably well in estimating genetic diversity
		  (Theta), it does poorly at estimating migration rates and
		  the confidence intervals associated with them. We recommend
		  researchers use this software with caution under conditions
		  similar to those used in this evaluation.}

  abstract	= {This paper studies gene trees in subdivided populations
		  which are constructed as perfect phylogenies from the
		  pattern of mutations in a sample of DNA sequences and
		  presents a new recursion for the probability distribution
		  of such gene trees. The underlying evolutionary model is
		  the coalescent process in a subdivided population. The
		  infinitely-many-sites model of mutation is assumed.
		  Ancestral inference questions that are discussed are
		  maximum likelihood estimation of migration and mutation
		  rates; detection of population growth by likelihood
		  techniques; determining the distribution of the time to the
		  most recent common ancestor of a sample of sequences;
		  determining the distribution of the age of the mutations on
		  the gene tree; determining in which subpopulation the most
		  recent common ancestor of all the sequences was;
		  determining subpopulation ancestors, where they were, and
		  times to them; and determining in which subpopulations
		  mutations occurred. A computational technique of Griffiths
		  and Tavare used is a computer intensive Markov chain
		  simulation, which simulates gene trees conditional on their
		  topology implied by the mutation pattern in the sample of
		  DNA sequences. The software GENETREE, which implements
		  these ancestral inference techniques, is available. (C)

		  method are shown by using simulated data from a
		  four-population n-island model and a source-sink population
		  model. Our estimation method as coded in MIGRATE is tested
		  against GENETREE; both programs deliver a very similar

		  using alternative coalescent methods. In the bison

		  adequately evaluated for their performance in accurately
		  estimating population genetic parameters of interest. In
		  this paper, we continue a research program of evaluation of
		  population genetic methods through computer simulation.
		  Specifically, we examine the software MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 and
		  test the accuracy of this software to estimate genetic
		  diversity (Theta), migration rates, and confidence
		  intervals. We simulated nucleotide sequence data under a
		  neutral coalescent model with lengths of 500 bp and 1000
		  bp, and with three different per site Theta values of
		  (0.00025, 0.0025, 0.025) crossed with four different
		  migration rates (0.0000025, 0.025, 0.25, 2.5) to construct
		  1000 evolutionary trees per-combination
		  per-sequence-length. We found that while MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8
		  performs reasonably well in estimating genetic diversity
		  (Theta), it does poorly at estimating migration rates and
		  the confidence intervals associated with them. We recommend
		  researchers use this software with caution under conditions
		  similar to those used in this evaluation.}

		  which are constructed as perfect phylogenies from the
		  pattern of mutations in a sample of DNA sequences and
		  presents a new recursion for the probability distribution
		  of such gene trees. The underlying evolutionary model is
		  the coalescent process in a subdivided population. The
		  infinitely-many-sites model of mutation is assumed.
		  Ancestral inference questions that are discussed are
		  maximum likelihood estimation of migration and mutation
		  rates; detection of population growth by likelihood
		  techniques; determining the distribution of the time to the
		  most recent common ancestor of a sample of sequences;
		  determining the distribution of the age of the mutations on
		  the gene tree; determining in which subpopulation the most
		  recent common ancestor of all the sequences was;
		  determining subpopulation ancestors, where they were, and
		  times to them; and determining in which subpopulations
		  mutations occurred. A computational technique of Griffiths
		  and Tavare used is a computer intensive Markov chain
		  simulation, which simulates gene trees conditional on their
		  topology implied by the mutation pattern in the sample of
		  DNA sequences. The software GENETREE, which implements
		  these ancestral inference techniques, is available. (C)

  abstract	= {A maximum likelihood estimator based on the coalescent for
		  unequal migration rates and different subpopulation sizes
		  is developed. The method uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo
		  approach to investigate possible genealogies with branch
		  lengths and with migration events. Properties of the new
		  method are shown by using simulated data from a
		  four-population n-island model and a source-sink population
		  model. Our estimation method as coded in MIGRATE is tested
		  against GENETREE; both programs deliver a very similar
		  likelihood surface. The algorithm converges to the
		  estimates fairly quickly, even when the Markov chain is
		  started from unfavorable parameters. The method was used to
		  estimate gene flow in the Nile valley by using mtDNA data
		  from three human populations.}

		  inferred from the sequences and provides a nonparametric
		  estimate of effective population size through time. In
		  contrast to previous related procedures, the generalized
		  skyline plot is more applicable to cases where the
		  underlying tree is not fully resolved and the data is not
		  highly variable. This is achieved by the grouping of
		  adjacent coalescent intervals. We employ a small-sample

		  of our approach using simulation and subsequently apply it
		  to HIV-1 sequences from central Africa and mtDNA sequences
		  from red pandas.}

		  compare the Bayesian skyline plot model to previous
		  coalescent approaches by analyzing two real data sets
		  (hepatitis C virus in Egypt and mitochondrial DNA of
		  Beringian bison) that have been previously investigated
		  using alternative coalescent methods. In the bison
		  analysis, we detect a severe but previously unrecognized
		  bottleneck, estimated to have occurred 10,000 radiocarbon
		  years ago, which coincides with both the earliest
		  undisputed record of large numbers of humans in Alaska and
		  the megafaunal extinctions in North America at the

		  contrast to previous related procedures, the generalized
		  skyline plot is more applicable to cases where the
		  underlying tree is not fully resolved and the data is not
		  highly variable. This is achieved by the grouping of
		  adjacent coalescent intervals. We employ a small-sample

		  of our approach using simulation and subsequently apply it
		  to HIV-1 sequences from central Africa and mtDNA sequences

		  adequately evaluated for their performance in accurately
		  estimating population genetic parameters of interest. In
		  this paper, we continue a research program of evaluation of
		  population genetic methods through computer simulation.
		  Specifically, we examine the software MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 and
		  test the accuracy of this software to estimate genetic
		  diversity (Theta), migration rates, and confidence
		  intervals. We simulated nucleotide sequence data under a
		  neutral coalescent model with lengths of 500 bp and 1000
		  bp, and with three different per site Theta values of
		  (0.00025, 0.0025, 0.025) crossed with four different
		  migration rates (0.0000025, 0.025, 0.25, 2.5) to construct
		  1000 evolutionary trees per-combination
		  per-sequence-length. We found that while MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8
		  performs reasonably well in estimating genetic diversity
		  (Theta), it does poorly at estimating migration rates and
		  the confidence intervals associated with them. We recommend
		  researchers use this software with caution under conditions
		  similar to those used in this evaluation.}

		  which are constructed as perfect phylogenies from the
		  pattern of mutations in a sample of DNA sequences and
		  presents a new recursion for the probability distribution
		  of such gene trees. The underlying evolutionary model is
		  the coalescent process in a subdivided population. The
		  infinitely-many-sites model of mutation is assumed.
		  Ancestral inference questions that are discussed are
		  maximum likelihood estimation of migration and mutation
		  rates; detection of population growth by likelihood
		  techniques; determining the distribution of the time to the
		  most recent common ancestor of a sample of sequences;
		  determining the distribution of the age of the mutations on
		  the gene tree; determining in which subpopulation the most
		  recent common ancestor of all the sequences was;
		  determining subpopulation ancestors, where they were, and
		  times to them; and determining in which subpopulations
		  mutations occurred. A computational technique of Griffiths
		  and Tavare used is a computer intensive Markov chain
		  simulation, which simulates gene trees conditional on their
		  topology implied by the mutation pattern in the sample of
		  DNA sequences. The software GENETREE, which implements
		  these ancestral inference techniques, is available. (C)

		  {M}etropolis-{H}astings algorithm) has been used for many
		  statistical problems, including Bayesian inference,
		  likelihood inference, and tests of significance. Though the
		  method generally works well, doubts about convergence often
		  remain. Here we propose MCMC methods distantly related to
		  simulated annealing. Our samplers mix rapidly enough to be
		  usable for problems in which other methods would require
		  eons of computing time. They simulate realizations from a
		  sequence of distributions, allowing the distribution being
		  simulated to vary randomly over time. If the sequence of
		  distributions is well chosen, then the sampler will mix
		  well and produce accurate answers for all the
		  distributions. Even when there is only one distribution of
		  interest, these annealing-like samplers may be the only
		  known way to get a rapidly mixing sampler. These methods
		  are essential for attacking very hard problems, which arise
		  in areas such as statistical genetics. We illustrate the
		  methods with an application that is much harder than any
		  problem previously done by MCMC, involving ancestral
		  inference on a very large genealogy (7 generations, 2,024
		  individuals). The problem is to find, conditional on data
		  on living individuals, the probabilities of each individual
		  having been a carrier of cystic fibrosis. Exact calculation
		  of these conditional probabilities is infeasible. Moreover,
		  a Gibbs sampler for the problem would not mix in a
		  reasonable time, even on the fastest imaginable computers.
		  Our annealing-like samplers have mixing times of a few
		  hours. We also give examples of samplers for the ''witch's
		  hat'' distribution and the conditional Strauss process.}

		  Specifically, we examine the software MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 and

		  per-sequence-length. We found that while MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8
		  performs reasonably well in estimating genetic diversity

		  unequal migration rates and different subpopulation sizes

		  approach to investigate possible genealogies with branch

		  method are shown by using simulated data from a
		  four-population n-island model and a source-sink population

		  that an appropriate likelihood formula can be constructed.
		  We present such likelihoods for several sampling methods.
		  As a test of these approaches, we consider use of SNPs to
		  estimate the parameter Theta = 4N(e)mu (the scaled product
		  of effective population size and per-site mutation rate),
		  which is related to the branch lengths of the reconstructed
		  genealogy. With infinite amounts of data, ML models using
		  SNP data are expected to produce consistent estimates of
		  Theta. With finite amounts of data the estimates are
		  accurate when Theta is high, but tend to be biased upward
		  when Theta is low. If recombination is present and not
		  allowed for in the analysis, the results are additionally
		  biased upward, but this effect can be removed by
		  incorporating recombination into the analysis. SNPs defined
		  as sites that are polymorphic in the actual sample under
		  consideration (sample SNPs) are somewhat more accurate for
		  estimation of Theta than SNPs defined by their polymorphism
		  in a panel chosen from the same population (panel SNPs).
		  Misrepresenting panel SNPs as sample SNPs leads to large
		  errors in the maximum likelihood estimate of Theta.
		  Researchers collecting SNPs should collect and preserve
		  information about the mettled of ascertainment so that the
		  data can be accurately analyzed.}

		  inferred from the sequences and provides a nonparametric
		  estimate of effective population size through time. In
		  contrast to previous related procedures, the generalized
		  skyline plot is more applicable to cases where the
		  underlying tree is not fully resolved and the data is not
		  highly variable. This is achieved by the grouping of
		  adjacent coalescent intervals. We employ a small-sample

		  of our approach using simulation and subsequently apply it
		  to HIV-1 sequences from central Africa and mtDNA sequences
		  from red pandas.}

		  compare the Bayesian skyline plot model to previous
		  coalescent approaches by analyzing two real data sets
		  (hepatitis C virus in Egypt and mitochondrial DNA of
		  Beringian bison) that have been previously investigated
		  using alternative coalescent methods. In the bison
		  analysis, we detect a severe but previously unrecognized
		  bottleneck, estimated to have occurred 10,000 radiocarbon

		  {M}etropolis-{H}astings algorithm) has been used for many
		  statistical problems, including Bayesian inference,
		  likelihood inference, and tests of significance. Though the
		  method generally works well, doubts about convergence often
		  remain. Here we propose MCMC methods distantly related to
		  simulated annealing. Our samplers mix rapidly enough to be
		  usable for problems in which other methods would require
		  eons of computing time. They simulate realizations from a
		  sequence of distributions, allowing the distribution being
		  simulated to vary randomly over time. If the sequence of
		  distributions is well chosen, then the sampler will mix
		  well and produce accurate answers for all the
		  distributions. Even when there is only one distribution of
		  interest, these annealing-like samplers may be the only
		  known way to get a rapidly mixing sampler. These methods
		  are essential for attacking very hard problems, which arise
		  in areas such as statistical genetics. We illustrate the
		  methods with an application that is much harder than any
		  problem previously done by MCMC, involving ancestral
		  inference on a very large genealogy (7 generations, 2,024
		  individuals). The problem is to find, conditional on data
		  on living individuals, the probabilities of each individual
		  having been a carrier of cystic fibrosis. Exact calculation
		  of these conditional probabilities is infeasible. Moreover,
		  a Gibbs sampler for the problem would not mix in a
		  reasonable time, even on the fastest imaginable computers.
		  Our annealing-like samplers have mixing times of a few
		  hours. We also give examples of samplers for the ''witch's
		  hat'' distribution and the conditional Strauss process.}

		  Specifically, we examine the software MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 and
		  test the accuracy of this software to estimate genetic
		  diversity (Theta), migration rates, and confidence
		  intervals. We simulated nucleotide sequence data under a
		  neutral coalescent model with lengths of 500 bp and 1000

		  (0.00025, 0.0025, 0.025) crossed with four different
		  migration rates (0.0000025, 0.025, 0.25, 2.5) to construct
		  1000 evolutionary trees per-combination
		  per-sequence-length. We found that while MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8
		  performs reasonably well in estimating genetic diversity
		  (Theta), it does poorly at estimating migration rates and

		  infinitely-many-sites model of mutation is assumed.
		  Ancestral inference questions that are discussed are
		  maximum likelihood estimation of migration and mutation
		  rates; detection of population growth by likelihood
		  techniques; determining the distribution of the time to the
		  most recent common ancestor of a sample of sequences;
		  determining the distribution of the age of the mutations on
		  the gene tree; determining in which subpopulation the most
		  recent common ancestor of all the sequences was;
		  determining subpopulation ancestors, where they were, and
		  times to them; and determining in which subpopulations
		  mutations occurred. A computational technique of Griffiths
		  and Tavare used is a computer intensive Markov chain
		  simulation, which simulates gene trees conditional on their
		  topology implied by the mutation pattern in the sample of
		  DNA sequences. The software GENETREE, which implements

		  We present such likelihoods for several sampling methods.
		  As a test of these approaches, we consider use of SNPs to
		  estimate the parameter Theta = 4N(e)mu (the scaled product
		  of effective population size and per-site mutation rate),
		  which is related to the branch lengths of the reconstructed
		  genealogy. With infinite amounts of data, ML models using
		  SNP data are expected to produce consistent estimates of
		  Theta. With finite amounts of data the estimates are
		  accurate when Theta is high, but tend to be biased upward
		  when Theta is low. If recombination is present and not
		  allowed for in the analysis, the results are additionally
		  biased upward, but this effect can be removed by
		  incorporating recombination into the analysis. SNPs defined
		  as sites that are polymorphic in the actual sample under
		  consideration (sample SNPs) are somewhat more accurate for
		  estimation of Theta than SNPs defined by their polymorphism
		  in a panel chosen from the same population (panel SNPs).
		  Misrepresenting panel SNPs as sample SNPs leads to large
		  errors in the maximum likelihood estimate of Theta.
		  Researchers collecting SNPs should collect and preserve
		  information about the mettled of ascertainment so that the
		  data can be accurately analyzed.}

		  {M}etropolis-{H}astings algorithm) has been used for many
		  statistical problems, including Bayesian inference,
		  likelihood inference, and tests of significance. Though the
		  method generally works well, doubts about convergence often
		  remain. Here we propose MCMC methods distantly related to
		  simulated annealing. Our samplers mix rapidly enough to be
		  usable for problems in which other methods would require
		  eons of computing time. They simulate realizations from a
		  sequence of distributions, allowing the distribution being
		  simulated to vary randomly over time. If the sequence of
		  distributions is well chosen, then the sampler will mix
		  well and produce accurate answers for all the
		  distributions. Even when there is only one distribution of
		  interest, these annealing-like samplers may be the only
		  known way to get a rapidly mixing sampler. These methods
		  are essential for attacking very hard problems, which arise
		  in areas such as statistical genetics. We illustrate the
		  methods with an application that is much harder than any
		  problem previously done by MCMC, involving ancestral
		  inference on a very large genealogy (7 generations, 2,024
		  individuals). The problem is to find, conditional on data
		  on living individuals, the probabilities of each individual
		  having been a carrier of cystic fibrosis. Exact calculation
		  of these conditional probabilities is infeasible. Moreover,
		  a Gibbs sampler for the problem would not mix in a
		  reasonable time, even on the fastest imaginable computers.
		  Our annealing-like samplers have mixing times of a few
		  hours. We also give examples of samplers for the ''witch's
		  hat'' distribution and the conditional Strauss process.}

		  skyline plot, to explore the demographic history of sampled
		  DNA sequences. This approach is based on a genealogy
		  inferred from the sequences and provides a nonparametric
		  estimate of effective population size through time. In
		  contrast to previous related procedures, the generalized
		  skyline plot is more applicable to cases where the
		  underlying tree is not fully resolved and the data is not
		  highly variable. This is achieved by the grouping of
		  adjacent coalescent intervals. We employ a small-sample
		  Akaike information criterion to objectively choose the
		  optimal grouping strategy. We investigate the performance
		  of our approach using simulation and subsequently apply it
		  to HIV-1 sequences from central Africa and mtDNA sequences
		  from red pandas.}

		  history. Very few of these methods, however, have been
		  adequately evaluated for their performance in accurately
		  estimating population genetic parameters of interest. In
		  this paper, we continue a research program of evaluation of
		  population genetic methods through computer simulation.
		  Specifically, we examine the software MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 and
		  test the accuracy of this software to estimate genetic
		  diversity (Theta), migration rates, and confidence
		  intervals. We simulated nucleotide sequence data under a
		  neutral coalescent model with lengths of 500 bp and 1000
		  bp, and with three different per site Theta values of
		  (0.00025, 0.0025, 0.025) crossed with four different
		  migration rates (0.0000025, 0.025, 0.25, 2.5) to construct
		  1000 evolutionary trees per-combination
		  per-sequence-length. We found that while MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8
		  performs reasonably well in estimating genetic diversity
		  (Theta), it does poorly at estimating migration rates and
		  the confidence intervals associated with them. We recommend
		  researchers use this software with caution under conditions
		  similar to those used in this evaluation.}

		  which are constructed as perfect phylogenies from the
		  pattern of mutations in a sample of DNA sequences and
		  presents a new recursion for the probability distribution
		  of such gene trees. The underlying evolutionary model is
		  the coalescent process in a subdivided population. The
		  infinitely-many-sites model of mutation is assumed.
		  Ancestral inference questions that are discussed are
		  maximum likelihood estimation of migration and mutation
		  rates; detection of population growth by likelihood
		  techniques; determining the distribution of the time to the
		  most recent common ancestor of a sample of sequences;
		  determining the distribution of the age of the mutations on
		  the gene tree; determining in which subpopulation the most
		  recent common ancestor of all the sequences was;
		  determining subpopulation ancestors, where they were, and
		  times to them; and determining in which subpopulations
		  mutations occurred. A computational technique of Griffiths
		  and Tavare used is a computer intensive Markov chain
		  simulation, which simulates gene trees conditional on their
		  topology implied by the mutation pattern in the sample of
		  DNA sequences. The software GENETREE, which implements
		  these ancestral inference techniques, is available. (C)

		  We present such likelihoods for several sampling methods.
		  As a test of these approaches, we consider use of SNPs to
		  estimate the parameter Theta = 4N(e)mu (the scaled product
		  of effective population size and per-site mutation rate),
		  which is related to the branch lengths of the reconstructed
		  genealogy. With infinite amounts of data, ML models using
		  SNP data are expected to produce consistent estimates of
		  Theta. With finite amounts of data the estimates are
		  accurate when Theta is high, but tend to be biased upward
		  when Theta is low. If recombination is present and not
		  allowed for in the analysis, the results are additionally
		  biased upward, but this effect can be removed by
		  incorporating recombination into the analysis. SNPs defined
		  as sites that are polymorphic in the actual sample under
		  consideration (sample SNPs) are somewhat more accurate for
		  estimation of Theta than SNPs defined by their polymorphism
		  in a panel chosen from the same population (panel SNPs).
		  Misrepresenting panel SNPs as sample SNPs leads to large
		  errors in the maximum likelihood estimate of Theta.
		  Researchers collecting SNPs should collect and preserve
		  information about the mettled of ascertainment so that the
		  data can be accurately analyzed.}

		  prespecified parametric model of demographic history. We
		  describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling procedure that
		  efficiently samples a variant of the generalized skyline
		  plot, given sequence data, and combines these plots to
		  generate a posterior distribution of effective population
		  size through time. We apply the Bayesian skyline plot to

		  compare the Bayesian skyline plot model to previous
		  coalescent approaches by analyzing two real data sets
		  (hepatitis C virus in Egypt and mitochondrial DNA of
		  Beringian bison) that have been previously investigated
		  using alternative coalescent methods. In the bison
		  analysis, we detect a severe but previously unrecognized
		  bottleneck, estimated to have occurred 10,000 radiocarbon
		  years ago, which coincides with both the earliest
		  undisputed record of large numbers of humans in Alaska and
		  the megafaunal extinctions in North America at the

		  {M}etropolis-{H}astings algorithm) has been used for many
		  statistical problems, including Bayesian inference,
		  likelihood inference, and tests of significance. Though the
		  method generally works well, doubts about convergence often
		  remain. Here we propose MCMC methods distantly related to
		  simulated annealing. Our samplers mix rapidly enough to be
		  usable for problems in which other methods would require
		  eons of computing time. They simulate realizations from a
		  sequence of distributions, allowing the distribution being
		  simulated to vary randomly over time. If the sequence of
		  distributions is well chosen, then the sampler will mix
		  well and produce accurate answers for all the
		  distributions. Even when there is only one distribution of
		  interest, these annealing-like samplers may be the only
		  known way to get a rapidly mixing sampler. These methods
		  are essential for attacking very hard problems, which arise
		  in areas such as statistical genetics. We illustrate the
		  methods with an application that is much harder than any
		  problem previously done by MCMC, involving ancestral
		  inference on a very large genealogy (7 generations, 2,024
		  individuals). The problem is to find, conditional on data
		  on living individuals, the probabilities of each individual
		  having been a carrier of cystic fibrosis. Exact calculation
		  of these conditional probabilities is infeasible. Moreover,
		  a Gibbs sampler for the problem would not mix in a
		  reasonable time, even on the fastest imaginable computers.
		  Our annealing-like samplers have mixing times of a few
		  hours. We also give examples of samplers for the ''witch's
		  hat'' distribution and the conditional Strauss process.}

  abstract	= {We present an intuitive visual framework, the generalized
		  skyline plot, to explore the demographic history of sampled
		  DNA sequences. This approach is based on a genealogy
		  inferred from the sequences and provides a nonparametric
		  estimate of effective population size through time. In
		  contrast to previous related procedures, the generalized
		  skyline plot is more applicable to cases where the
		  underlying tree is not fully resolved and the data is not
		  highly variable. This is achieved by the grouping of
		  adjacent coalescent intervals. We employ a small-sample
		  Akaike information criterion to objectively choose the
		  optimal grouping strategy. We investigate the performance
		  of our approach using simulation and subsequently apply it
		  to HIV-1 sequences from central Africa and mtDNA sequences
		  from red pandas.}

		  developed to estimate components of population genetic
		  history. Very few of these methods, however, have been
		  adequately evaluated for their performance in accurately
		  estimating population genetic parameters of interest. In
		  this paper, we continue a research program of evaluation of
		  population genetic methods through computer simulation.
		  Specifically, we examine the software MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 and
		  test the accuracy of this software to estimate genetic
		  diversity (Theta), migration rates, and confidence
		  intervals. We simulated nucleotide sequence data under a
		  neutral coalescent model with lengths of 500 bp and 1000
		  bp, and with three different per site Theta values of
		  (0.00025, 0.0025, 0.025) crossed with four different
		  migration rates (0.0000025, 0.025, 0.25, 2.5) to construct
		  1000 evolutionary trees per-combination
		  per-sequence-length. We found that while MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8
		  performs reasonably well in estimating genetic diversity
		  (Theta), it does poorly at estimating migration rates and
		  the confidence intervals associated with them. We recommend
		  researchers use this software with caution under conditions
		  similar to those used in this evaluation.}

  abstract	= {This paper studies gene trees in subdivided populations
		  which are constructed as perfect phylogenies from the
		  pattern of mutations in a sample of DNA sequences and
		  presents a new recursion for the probability distribution
		  of such gene trees. The underlying evolutionary model is
		  the coalescent process in a subdivided population. The
		  infinitely-many-sites model of mutation is assumed.
		  Ancestral inference questions that are discussed are
		  maximum likelihood estimation of migration and mutation
		  rates; detection of population growth by likelihood
		  techniques; determining the distribution of the time to the
		  most recent common ancestor of a sample of sequences;
		  determining the distribution of the age of the mutations on
		  the gene tree; determining in which subpopulation the most
		  recent common ancestor of all the sequences was;
		  determining subpopulation ancestors, where they were, and
		  times to them; and determining in which subpopulations
		  mutations occurred. A computational technique of Griffiths
		  and Tavare used is a computer intensive Markov chain
		  simulation, which simulates gene trees conditional on their
		  topology implied by the mutation pattern in the sample of
		  DNA sequences. The software GENETREE, which implements
		  these ancestral inference techniques, is available. (C)

		  As a test of these approaches, we consider use of SNPs to
		  estimate the parameter Theta = 4N(e)mu (the scaled product
		  of effective population size and per-site mutation rate),
		  which is related to the branch lengths of the reconstructed
		  genealogy. With infinite amounts of data, ML models using
		  SNP data are expected to produce consistent estimates of
		  Theta. With finite amounts of data the estimates are
		  accurate when Theta is high, but tend to be biased upward
		  when Theta is low. If recombination is present and not
		  allowed for in the analysis, the results are additionally
		  biased upward, but this effect can be removed by
		  incorporating recombination into the analysis. SNPs defined
		  as sites that are polymorphic in the actual sample under
		  consideration (sample SNPs) are somewhat more accurate for
		  estimation of Theta than SNPs defined by their polymorphism
		  in a panel chosen from the same population (panel SNPs).
		  Misrepresenting panel SNPs as sample SNPs leads to large
		  errors in the maximum likelihood estimate of Theta.
		  Researchers collecting SNPs should collect and preserve
		  information about the mettled of ascertainment so that the
		  data can be accurately analyzed.}

		  using alternative coalescent methods. In the bison

		  method generally works well, doubts about convergence often
		  remain. Here we propose MCMC methods distantly related to
		  simulated annealing. Our samplers mix rapidly enough to be
		  usable for problems in which other methods would require
		  eons of computing time. They simulate realizations from a
		  sequence of distributions, allowing the distribution being
		  simulated to vary randomly over time. If the sequence of
		  distributions is well chosen, then the sampler will mix
		  well and produce accurate answers for all the
		  distributions. Even when there is only one distribution of
		  interest, these annealing-like samplers may be the only
		  known way to get a rapidly mixing sampler. These methods
		  are essential for attacking very hard problems, which arise
		  in areas such as statistical genetics. We illustrate the
		  methods with an application that is much harder than any
		  problem previously done by MCMC, involving ancestral
		  inference on a very large genealogy (7 generations, 2,024
		  individuals). The problem is to find, conditional on data
		  on living individuals, the probabilities of each individual
		  having been a carrier of cystic fibrosis. Exact calculation
		  of these conditional probabilities is infeasible. Moreover,
		  a Gibbs sampler for the problem would not mix in a
		  reasonable time, even on the fastest imaginable computers.
		  Our annealing-like samplers have mixing times of a few
		  hours. We also give examples of samplers for the ''witch's
		  hat'' distribution and the conditional Strauss process.}

		  this paper, we continue a research program of evaluation of
		  population genetic methods through computer simulation.
		  Specifically, we examine the software MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 and
		  test the accuracy of this software to estimate genetic
		  diversity (Theta), migration rates, and confidence
		  intervals. We simulated nucleotide sequence data under a
		  neutral coalescent model with lengths of 500 bp and 1000
		  bp, and with three different per site Theta values of
		  (0.00025, 0.0025, 0.025) crossed with four different
		  migration rates (0.0000025, 0.025, 0.25, 2.5) to construct
		  1000 evolutionary trees per-combination
		  per-sequence-length. We found that while MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8
		  performs reasonably well in estimating genetic diversity
		  (Theta), it does poorly at estimating migration rates and
		  the confidence intervals associated with them. We recommend
		  researchers use this software with caution under conditions

		  the coalescent process in a subdivided population. The
		  infinitely-many-sites model of mutation is assumed.
		  Ancestral inference questions that are discussed are
		  maximum likelihood estimation of migration and mutation
		  rates; detection of population growth by likelihood
		  techniques; determining the distribution of the time to the
		  most recent common ancestor of a sample of sequences;
		  determining the distribution of the age of the mutations on
		  the gene tree; determining in which subpopulation the most
		  recent common ancestor of all the sequences was;
		  determining subpopulation ancestors, where they were, and
		  times to them; and determining in which subpopulations
		  mutations occurred. A computational technique of Griffiths
		  and Tavare used is a computer intensive Markov chain
		  simulation, which simulates gene trees conditional on their
		  topology implied by the mutation pattern in the sample of
		  DNA sequences. The software GENETREE, which implements
		  these ancestral inference techniques, is available. (C)

		  accurate when Theta is high, but tend to be biased upward
		  when Theta is low. If recombination is present and not
		  allowed for in the analysis, the results are additionally
		  biased upward, but this effect can be removed by
		  incorporating recombination into the analysis. SNPs defined
		  as sites that are polymorphic in the actual sample under
		  consideration (sample SNPs) are somewhat more accurate for
		  estimation of Theta than SNPs defined by their polymorphism
		  in a panel chosen from the same population (panel SNPs).
		  Misrepresenting panel SNPs as sample SNPs leads to large
		  errors in the maximum likelihood estimate of Theta.
		  Researchers collecting SNPs should collect and preserve
		  information about the mettled of ascertainment so that the
		  data can be accurately analyzed.}

		  Beringian bison) that have been previously investigated
		  using alternative coalescent methods. In the bison

		  {M}etropolis-{H}astings algorithm) has been used for many
		  statistical problems, including Bayesian inference,
		  likelihood inference, and tests of significance. Though the
		  method generally works well, doubts about convergence often
		  remain. Here we propose MCMC methods distantly related to
		  simulated annealing. Our samplers mix rapidly enough to be
		  usable for problems in which other methods would require
		  eons of computing time. They simulate realizations from a
		  sequence of distributions, allowing the distribution being
		  simulated to vary randomly over time. If the sequence of
		  distributions is well chosen, then the sampler will mix
		  well and produce accurate answers for all the
		  distributions. Even when there is only one distribution of
		  interest, these annealing-like samplers may be the only
		  known way to get a rapidly mixing sampler. These methods
		  are essential for attacking very hard problems, which arise
		  in areas such as statistical genetics. We illustrate the
		  methods with an application that is much harder than any
		  problem previously done by MCMC, involving ancestral
		  inference on a very large genealogy (7 generations, 2,024
		  individuals). The problem is to find, conditional on data
		  on living individuals, the probabilities of each individual
		  having been a carrier of cystic fibrosis. Exact calculation
		  of these conditional probabilities is infeasible. Moreover,
		  a Gibbs sampler for the problem would not mix in a
		  reasonable time, even on the fastest imaginable computers.
		  Our annealing-like samplers have mixing times of a few
		  hours. We also give examples of samplers for the ''witch's
		  hat'' distribution and the conditional Strauss process.}

		  branch lengths and with migration events. Properties of the
		  new method are shown by using simulated data from a
		  four-population n-island model and a source-sink population
		  model. Our estimation method as coded in MIGRATE is tested
		  against GENETREE; both programs deliver a very similar
		  likelihood surface. The algorithm converges to the
		  estimates fairly quickly, even when the Markov chain is
		  started from unfavorable parameters. The method was used to
		  estimate gene flow in the Nile valley by using mtDNA data
		  from three human populations.},

  abstract	= {A plethora of statistical models have recently been
		  developed to estimate components of population genetic
		  history. Very few of these methods, however, have been
		  adequately evaluated for their performance in accurately
		  estimating population genetic parameters of interest. In
		  this paper, we continue a research program of evaluation of
		  population genetic methods through computer simulation.
		  Specifically, we examine the software MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 and
		  test the accuracy of this software to estimate genetic
		  diversity (Theta), migration rates, and confidence
		  intervals. We simulated nucleotide sequence data under a
		  neutral coalescent model with lengths of 500 bp and 1000
		  bp, and with three different per site Theta values of
		  (0.00025, 0.0025, 0.025) crossed with four different
		  migration rates (0.0000025, 0.025, 0.25, 2.5) to construct
		  1000 evolutionary trees per-combination
		  per-sequence-length. We found that while MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8
		  performs reasonably well in estimating genetic diversity
		  (Theta), it does poorly at estimating migration rates and
		  the confidence intervals associated with them. We recommend
		  researchers use this software with caution under conditions
		  similar to those used in this evaluation.},

  abstract	= {This paper studies gene trees in subdivided populations
		  which are constructed as perfect phylogenies from the
		  pattern of mutations in a sample of DNA sequences and
		  presents a new recursion for the probability distribution
		  of such gene trees. The underlying evolutionary model is
		  the coalescent process in a subdivided population. The
		  infinitely-many-sites model of mutation is assumed.
		  Ancestral inference questions that are discussed are
		  maximum likelihood estimation of migration and mutation
		  rates; detection of population growth by likelihood
		  techniques; determining the distribution of the time to the
		  most recent common ancestor of a sample of sequences;
		  determining the distribution of the age of the mutations on
		  the gene tree; determining in which subpopulation the most
		  recent common ancestor of all the sequences was;
		  determining subpopulation ancestors, where they were, and
		  times to them; and determining in which subpopulations
		  mutations occurred. A computational technique of Griffiths
		  and Tavare used is a computer intensive Markov chain
		  simulation, which simulates gene trees conditional on their
		  topology implied by the mutation pattern in the sample of
		  DNA sequences. The software GENETREE, which implements
		  these ancestral inference techniques, is available. (C)

  abstract	= {Current estimators of gene flow come in two methods; those
		  that estimate parameters assuming that the populations
		  investigated are a small random sample of a large number of
		  populations and those that assume that all populations were
		  sampled. Maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches that
		  estimate the migration rates and population sizes directly
		  using coalescent theory can easily accommodate datasets
		  that contain a population that has no data, a so-called
		  'ghost' population. This manipulation allows us to explore
		  the effects of missing populations on the estimation of
		  population sizes and migration rates between two specific
		  populations. The biases of the inferred population
		  parameters depend on the magnitude of the migration rate
		  from the unknown populations. The effects on the population
		  sizes are larger than the effects on the migration rates.
		  The more immigrants from the unknown populations that are
		  arriving in the sample populations the larger the estimated
		  population sizes. Taking into account a ghost population
		  improves or at least does not harm the estimation of
		  population sizes. Estimates of the scaled migration rate M
		  (migration rate per generation divided by the mutation rate
		  per generation) are fairly robust as long as migration
		  rates from the unknown populations are not huge. The
		  inclusion of a ghost population does not improve the
		  estimation of the migration rate M; when the migration
		  rates are estimated as the number of immigrants Nm then a
		  ghost population improves the estimates because of its
		  effect on population size estimation. It seems that for
		  'real world' analyses one should carefully choose which
		  populations to sample, but there is no need to sample every
		  population in the neighbourhood of a population of
		  interest.},

		  We present such likelihoods for several sampling methods.
		  As a test of these approaches, we consider use of SNPs to
		  estimate the parameter Theta = 4N(e)mu (the scaled product
		  of effective population size and per-site mutation rate),
		  which is related to the branch lengths of the reconstructed
		  genealogy. With infinite amounts of data, ML models using

		  accurate when Theta is high, but tend to be biased upward
		  when Theta is low. If recombination is present and not
		  allowed for in the analysis, the results are additionally
		  biased upward, but this effect can be removed by
		  incorporating recombination into the analysis. SNPs defined
		  as sites that are polymorphic in the actual sample under
		  consideration (sample SNPs) are somewhat more accurate for
		  estimation of Theta than SNPs defined by their polymorphism
		  in a panel chosen from the same population (panel SNPs).
		  Misrepresenting panel SNPs as sample SNPs leads to large

		  Researchers collecting SNPs should collect and preserve

  abstract	= {Markov chain {M}onte {C}arlo (MCMC; the
		  {M}etropolis-{H}astings algorithm) has been used for many
		  statistical problems, including Bayesian inference,
		  likelihood inference, and tests of significance. Though the
		  method generally works well, doubts about convergence often
		  remain. Here we propose MCMC methods distantly related to
		  simulated annealing. Our samplers mix rapidly enough to be
		  usable for problems in which other methods would require
		  eons of computing time. They simulate realizations from a
		  sequence of distributions, allowing the distribution being
		  simulated to vary randomly over time. If the sequence of
		  distributions is well chosen, then the sampler will mix
		  well and produce accurate answers for all the
		  distributions. Even when there is only one distribution of
		  interest, these annealing-like samplers may be the only
		  known way to get a rapidly mixing sampler. These methods
		  are essential for attacking very hard problems, which arise
		  in areas such as statistical genetics. We illustrate the
		  methods with an application that is much harder than any
		  problem previously done by MCMC, involving ancestral
		  inference on a very large genealogy (7 generations, 2,024
		  individuals). The problem is to find, conditional on data
		  on living individuals, the probabilities of each individual
		  having been a carrier of cystic fibrosis. Exact calculation
		  of these conditional probabilities is infeasible. Moreover,
		  a Gibbs sampler for the problem would not mix in a
		  reasonable time, even on the fastest imaginable computers.
		  Our annealing-like samplers have mixing times of a few
		  hours. We also give examples of samplers for the ''witch's
		  hat'' distribution and the conditional Strauss process.},

  abstract	= {We present a new way to make a maximum likelihood estimate
		  of the parameter 4N mu (effective population size times
		  mutation rate per site, or theta) based on a population
		  sample of molecular sequences. We use a
		  {M}etropolis-{H}astings Markov chain {M}onte {C}arlo method
		  to sample genealogies in proportion to the product of their
		  likelihood with respect to the data and their prior
		  probability with respect to a coalescent distribution. A
		  specific value of theta must be chosen to generate the
		  coalescent distribution, but the resulting trees can be
		  used to evaluate the likelihood at other values of theta,
		  generating a likelihood curve. This procedure concentrates
		  sampling on those genealogies that contribute most of the
		  likelihood, allowing estimation of meaningful likelihood
		  curves based on relatively small samples. The method can
		  potentially be extended to cases involving varying
		  population size, recombination, and migration.},

@Article{	  rienzo:1994:mps,
  abstract	= {Mutational processes of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in
		  complex genomes are poorly understood. We examined these
		  processes by introducing a two-phase mutation model. In
		  this model, most mutations are single-step changes, but
		  infrequent large jumps in repeat number also occur. We used
		  computer simulations to determine expected values of
		  statistics that reflect frequency distributions of allele
		  size for the two-phase model and two alternatives, the
		  one-step and geometric models. The theoretical expectations
		  for each model were tested by comparison with observed
		  values for 10 SSR loci genotyped in the Sardinian
		  population, whose genetic and demographic histories have
		  been previously reconstructed. The two-phase model provided
		  the best fit to the data for most of these loci in this
		  population. In the analysis we assumed that the loci were
		  neutral and that this population had undergone rapid
		  population growth. Recent observations made for unstable
		  trinucleotide repeats support our suggestion that frequent
		  small changes and rare large changes in repeat number
		  represent two distinct classes of mutation at SSR loci. We
		  genotyped the same 10 loci in Egyptian and sub-Saharan
		  African samples to assess the utility of SSRs for studying
		  the divergence of populations and found that estimates of
		  interpopulation distances from SSRs were similar to those
		  derived from analysis of mitochondrial DNA.},
