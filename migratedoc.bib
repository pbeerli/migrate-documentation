@article{beerli2019b,
	abstract = {Divergence time estimation from multilocus genetic data has become common in population genetics and phylogenetics. We present a new Bayes inference method that treats the divergence time as a random variable. The divergence time is calculated from an assembly of splitting events on individual lineages in a genealogy. The waiting time for such a splitting event is drawn from a hazard function of the truncated normal distribution. This allows easy integration into the standard coalescence framework used in programs such as MIGRATE. We explore the accuracy of the new inference method with simulated population splittings over a wide range of divergence time values and with a dataset of the Zika virus; the geographic analyses of the expansion of the pathogen follows a trajectory from Africa to Asia to America, corroborating analyses based only on the dates of incidences. Evaluations of simple divergence models show high accuracy, whereas the accuracy of the results of isolation with migration (IM) models depend on the magnitude of the immigration rate and potentially on the number of samples. High immigration rates lead to a time of the most recent common ancestor of the sample that predates the divergence time, thus loses any potential signal of the divergence event in the sample data. This reduced accuracy with high immigration rates is problematic for all IM methods, including ours.},

		  pattern of mutations in a sample of DNA sequences and
		  presents a new recursion for the probability distribution
		  of such gene trees. The underlying evolutionary model is
		  the coalescent process in a subdivided population. The
		  infinitely-many-sites model of mutation is assumed.
		  Ancestral inference questions that are discussed are
		  maximum likelihood estimation of migration and mutation
		  rates; detection of population growth by likelihood
		  techniques; determining the distribution of the time to the
		  most recent common ancestor of a sample of sequences;
		  determining the distribution of the age of the mutations on
		  the gene tree; determining in which subpopulation the most
		  recent common ancestor of all the sequences was;
		  determining subpopulation ancestors, where they were, and
		  times to them; and determining in which subpopulations
		  mutations occurred. A computational technique of Griffiths
		  and Tavare used is a computer intensive Markov chain
		  simulation, which simulates gene trees conditional on their
		  topology implied by the mutation pattern in the sample of

		  this paper, we continue a research program of evaluation of

		  Specifically, we examine the software MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 and

		  diversity (Theta), migration rates, and confidence
		  intervals. We simulated nucleotide sequence data under a
		  neutral coalescent model with lengths of 500 bp and 1000
		  bp, and with three different per site Theta values of
		  (0.00025, 0.0025, 0.025) crossed with four different

		  1000 evolutionary trees per-combination
		  per-sequence-length. We found that while MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8

		  {M}etropolis-{H}astings algorithm) has been used for many
		  statistical problems, including Bayesian inference,
		  likelihood inference, and tests of significance. Though the
		  method generally works well, doubts about convergence often
		  remain. Here we propose MCMC methods distantly related to
		  simulated annealing. Our samplers mix rapidly enough to be
		  usable for problems in which other methods would require
		  eons of computing time. They simulate realizations from a
		  sequence of distributions, allowing the distribution being
		  simulated to vary randomly over time. If the sequence of
		  distributions is well chosen, then the sampler will mix
		  well and produce accurate answers for all the
		  distributions. Even when there is only one distribution of
		  interest, these annealing-like samplers may be the only
		  known way to get a rapidly mixing sampler. These methods
		  are essential for attacking very hard problems, which arise
		  in areas such as statistical genetics. We illustrate the
		  methods with an application that is much harder than any
		  problem previously done by MCMC, involving ancestral
		  inference on a very large genealogy (7 generations, 2,024
		  individuals). The problem is to find, conditional on data
		  on living individuals, the probabilities of each individual
		  having been a carrier of cystic fibrosis. Exact calculation
		  of these conditional probabilities is infeasible. Moreover,
		  a Gibbs sampler for the problem would not mix in a
		  reasonable time, even on the fastest imaginable computers.
		  Our annealing-like samplers have mixing times of a few
		  hours. We also give examples of samplers for the ''witch's

	abstract = {Mutational processes of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in
		  complex genomes are poorly understood. We examined these
		  processes by introducing a two-phase mutation model. In
		  this model, most mutations are single-step changes, but
		  infrequent large jumps in repeat number also occur. We used
		  computer simulations to determine expected values of
		  statistics that reflect frequency distributions of allele
		  size for the two-phase model and two alternatives, the
		  one-step and geometric models. The theoretical expectations
		  for each model were tested by comparison with observed
		  values for 10 SSR loci genotyped in the Sardinian
		  population, whose genetic and demographic histories have
		  been previously reconstructed. The two-phase model provided
		  the best fit to the data for most of these loci in this
		  population. In the analysis we assumed that the loci were
		  neutral and that this population had undergone rapid
		  population growth. Recent observations made for unstable
		  trinucleotide repeats support our suggestion that frequent
		  small changes and rare large changes in repeat number
		  represent two distinct classes of mutation at SSR loci. We
		  genotyped the same 10 loci in Egyptian and sub-Saharan
		  African samples to assess the utility of SSRs for studying
		  the divergence of populations and found that estimates of
		  interpopulation distances from SSRs were similar to those
		  derived from analysis of mitochondrial DNA.},

@article{beerli:2004:eup,
	abstract = {Current estimators of gene flow come in two methods; those
		  that estimate parameters assuming that the populations
		  investigated are a small random sample of a large number of
		  populations and those that assume that all populations were
		  sampled. Maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches that
		  estimate the migration rates and population sizes directly
		  using coalescent theory can easily accommodate datasets
		  that contain a population that has no data, a so-called
		  'ghost' population. This manipulation allows us to explore
		  the effects of missing populations on the estimation of
		  population sizes and migration rates between two specific
		  populations. The biases of the inferred population
		  parameters depend on the magnitude of the migration rate
		  from the unknown populations. The effects on the population
		  sizes are larger than the effects on the migration rates.
		  The more immigrants from the unknown populations that are
		  arriving in the sample populations the larger the estimated
		  population sizes. Taking into account a ghost population
		  improves or at least does not harm the estimation of
		  population sizes. Estimates of the scaled migration rate M
		  (migration rate per generation divided by the mutation rate
		  per generation) are fairly robust as long as migration
		  rates from the unknown populations are not huge. The
		  inclusion of a ghost population does not improve the
		  estimation of the migration rate M; when the migration
		  rates are estimated as the number of immigrants Nm then a
		  ghost population improves the estimates because of its
		  effect on population size estimation. It seems that for
		  'real world' analyses one should carefully choose which
		  populations to sample, but there is no need to sample every
		  population in the neighbourhood of a population of
		  interest.},

		  other methods on simulated data demonstrate that this new
		  approach is attractive in terms of both accuracy and speed
		  of computation. Our simulation experiments also demonstrate
		  that, despite the theoretical advantages of
		  full-likelihood-based methods, methods based on certain
		  summary statistics (specifically, the sample homozygosity)
		  can perform very competitively in practice. },
